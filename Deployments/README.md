# Kubernetes Deployments Guide

This repository provides a simple guide and example commands to help you understand and work with Kubernetes Deployments, DaemonSets, and StatefulSets.

## Overview

### Deployments
Deployments are used by 99.99% of people to deploy their applications. They include ReplicaSets and Pods.

### DaemonSets
DaemonSets ensure that a pod is run on each node in the cluster. This is typically used for log collection and monitoring.

### StatefulSets
StatefulSets maintain the identity of pods, ensuring the hostname remains the same, which is crucial for stateful applications like MongoDB and MySQL.

## Commands Used

### Creating a Deployment
```sh
kubectl create deployment testapp --image kiran2361993/kubegame:v1 --replicas 3 --dry-run -o yaml
```

### Adding Another Container
Add the following container to the deployment:
- Image: `kiran2361993/mydb:v1`
- Name: `Database`

### Labels and Annotations
Labels are key-value pairs used to pass information.

#### Creating Pods
```sh
kubectl run testpod1 --image nginx:latest
```

### Deploying the Deployment
```sh
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl get pods
```

### Adding Annotations
Annotations can pass information such as:
- Info: "This Deployment file has been created by me"
- Email: "sadanandakrrish@gmail.com"
- Owner: "sadananda"

### Environment Variables
Set environment variables at the container level:
```yaml
env:
  - name: DB_NAME
    value: "mysqldb"
  - name: DB_PORT
    value: "3306"
  - name: DB_URL
    value: "sada.in/mydb"
```

### Checking Environment Variables
```sh
kubectl describe pod <podname>
kubectl exec -it <podname> -- bash
env
```

### Exposing the Deployment
```sh
kubectl expose deployment testapp --name sv1 --port 8000 --target-port 80 --type NodePort
kubectl expose deployment testapp --name sv2 --port 5000 --target-port 5000 --type NodePort
```

### Strategy
```sh
kubectl explain deployment.spec.strategy
```
Under spec:
```yaml
strategy:
  rollingUpdate:
    maxSurge: 1
    maxUnavailable: 0%
```

### Deployment Update Strategy
```sh
kubectl edit deployment testapp
```
Under spec:
```yaml
minReadySeconds: 10
maxUnavailable: 0
```

### DaemonSets and StatefulSets
#### DaemonSets
DaemonSets ensure that one pod is run on each node.

#### StatefulSets
StatefulSets maintain the identity of pods, ensuring the hostname remains the same.

## Interview Questions

**What is the difference between Deployments, DaemonSets, and StatefulSets?**

- **Deployments**: Used for stateless applications, allowing for scaling up and down without dependencies on pod names.
- **DaemonSets**: Ensure one pod per node, typically used for log collection and monitoring.
- **StatefulSets**: Maintain pod identity, crucial for stateful applications like databases.
